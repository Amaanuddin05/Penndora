Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (v14+)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) (for deployment)

### üß™ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amaanuddin05/Penndora.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Penndora
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser. The application will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source files.

### üî• Firebase Configuration

This project uses Firebase for authentication, database, and hosting. For security reasons, the Firebase configuration is not included in the repository. 

To set up Firebase for this project:

1. Create a file named `firebase.environment.ts` in the `src/environments/` directory
2. Add your Firebase configuration:

```typescript
export const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
};
```

3. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase project credentials.

### üåê Environment Setup

The project uses environment files for configuration. For security, these files are not included in the repository. You'll need to create them:

1. Create `src/environments/environment.ts` for development:
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  geminiApiUrl: 'YOUR_API_URL'
};
```

2. Create `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` for production:
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  geminiApiUrl: 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_API_URL'
};
```

3. Create `src/environments/firebase.environment.ts` with your Firebase config (see above)

**Note:** All environment files are included in `.gitignore` to prevent exposing sensitive information.
